# nzhl-hammerspoon

Hammerspoon is a versatile tool on Mac but unfortunately only little people know it. Here is my hammer config which is inspired by [awesome-hammerspoon](https://github.com/ashfinal/awesome-hammerspoon). His config is much powerful than me, but i found it's a little too fat for me, so I just write my own. 

## Get started

1. Install [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/) first.
2. `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/nzhl/nzhl-hammerspoon ~/.hammerspoon`
3. Reload the configutation.

and you're set.

## Some features

My config mainly implemented those following features :

1. relax your eyes (auto lock the screen after every given interval)   
   + default time is 45 minutes 
   + currently unavailable
2. caffeinate 
   + always keep your screen on, in fact there is an app with the same name that special for this function.
   + default on, click the cafe cup to toggle it
3. google translator (need internet)
   + press the hotkey <shift + space> to show.
