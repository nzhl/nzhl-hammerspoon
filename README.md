# nzhl-hammerspoon

Hammerspoon is a versatile tool on Mac but unfortunately only little people know it. Here is my hammer config which is inspired by [awesome-hammerspoon](https://github.com/ashfinal/awesome-hammerspoon). His config is much powerful than me, but i found it's a little too fat for me, so I just write my own. 

## Get started

1. Install [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/) first.
2. `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ashfinal/awesome-hammerspoon.git ~/.hammerspoon`
3. Reload the configutation.

and you're set.

## Some features

My config mainly implemented those following features :

1. timer (check your menu after set my config)
   + count down for 15 / 30 / 45 / 60, after that a system notification will send
2. caffeinate 
   + always keep your screen on, in fact there is an app with the same name that special for this function.
   + default on, click the cafe cup to toggle it
3. spotlight-like chooser  (iTunes controller + sleep your computer )
   + press the hotkey <Option + s> to show, then you will know
4. desktop text 
   + change your /HOME/.hammerspoon/todo.txt, then the text will display in your desktop.
